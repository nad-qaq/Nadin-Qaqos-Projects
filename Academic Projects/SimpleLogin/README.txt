This assignment's purpose is to show that I am able to create a simple GUI that allows a user to login and fill out a form that saves the information into a database in NetBeans. To run the program you just have to run it from the options provided on the application. The output will show a login screen that the user can login using the username "username123" and the password "password123" (not very secure obviously, but for the assignment it is doable). The program is working correctly if it writes to the database properly, which it should. 
There is a pdf provided that has screenshots of the info being saved to the database.
