This assignment's purpose is to show that I am able to create a simple GUI using frames, labels, text fields, radio buttons, regular buttons, and how to write to a file. To run the program you just have to run it from the options provided on the application. The output for this will not output anything to the terminal. It will instead write something to the file. If something gets written to the files then you know that the code is working.
